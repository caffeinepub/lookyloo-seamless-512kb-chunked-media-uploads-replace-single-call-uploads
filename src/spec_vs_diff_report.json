REQ-14 (footer social links behavior) cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff; only the GeekGoat link is clearly evidenced, while the X icon link/behavior is not visible.

      "reason": "The diff snippet for the footer is truncated and only clearly shows a clickable GeekGoat icon link; it does not provide visible evidence of an X icon/link to https://x.com/WillGeek4Food, nor does it show whether the surrounding row/text is non-clickable.",
