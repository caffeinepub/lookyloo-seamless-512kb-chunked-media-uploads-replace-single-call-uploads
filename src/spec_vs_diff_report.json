  "summary": "The diff updates `frontend/index.html` to reference `/favicon.ico` and cache-busted PNG favicons, but it does not add the required favicon asset files under `frontend/public/`, and it introduces unrelated changes (notably an unrelated page title and project tracking/notes edits).",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the app serves a valid root favicon at `/favicon.ico` by adding `frontend/public/favicon.ico`.",
