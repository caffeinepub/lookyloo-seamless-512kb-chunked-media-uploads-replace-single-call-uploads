REQ-11 is partially implemented (HTML references favicon), but presence of the favicon.ico file at the public path is not evidenced. Also, index.html title was changed to unrelated chunked-upload wording, which was not requested (cosmetic/branding refresh only).",

      "reason": "The Landing cards are placed in a responsive grid (md:grid-cols-3) but there is no explicit styling to enforce equal heights (e.g., h-full/flex) across cards; content-length differences could produce uneven heights.",
