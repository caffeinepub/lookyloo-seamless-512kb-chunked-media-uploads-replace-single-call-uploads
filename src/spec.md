# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Adjust the header layout, landing-page title styling, and footer social icon link behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the header so the circular LookyLoo logo is aligned to the far left, with the exact text "Hey there, LookyLoo!  Wanna see somethin'?" immediately to its right, while keeping auth controls (and Upload when authenticated) aligned on the right.
- On the unauthenticated landing page only, style the H1 title text "LookyLoo" to be orange and use a calligraphy-style (or similar) font, without affecting header text styling.
- Update the footer "Follow me on" row so only the GeekGoat icon and the X icon are clickable, and set the X icon link target to https://x.com/WillGeek4Food (without making the full row clickable).

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a left-aligned logo with the specified greeting in the header, an orange calligraphy-style "LookyLoo" title on the unauthenticated landing page, and footer social links that work only when clicking the GeekGoat or X icons (with X linking to the provided URL).
